# 📊 Data Science Internship – End-to-End Project
Virtual Data Science with Python | YuvaIntern

# 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains all tasks completed during my Virtual Data Science with Python Internship at YuvaIntern.

The internship focused on building strong foundations in data science through hands-on tasks, covering:

Data acquisition and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization and storytelling

Statistical hypothesis testing

Machine learning model development and evaluation

The Titanic passenger dataset was used to demonstrate real-world data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.
